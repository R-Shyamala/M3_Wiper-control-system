# INTRODUCTION
The wiper is an important component that cleans the windscreen of rains or any other liquid. Wipers are designed and manufactured to remove water from a windshield. The majority of automobiles have two wipers on the windshield, one on the back window, and one on each headlight. The rubber blade, the wiper arm that holds the blade, a spring linkage, and portions of the wiper pivots are all visible from the outside of the car. Under the wiper, there are around six pieces called pressure points or claws, which are little arms. This project is mainly about developing wiper control system using STM32. Its aim is to make the wiper control system by using a button and 4 LED's. This wiper control system uses 3 LED's to control the wipers and one LED is for acc mode of the car to ON or OFF mode. If we press the button for 2 or 3 seconds the car should ON or OFF. If we press the button for one second the speed of the wiper should be changed. This is the over all idea of the project.

# INTRODUCTION STM32
STM32 is an STMicroelectronics family of 32-bit microcontroller integrated circuits.The unrivalled and extensive range of STM32 devices, which are based on an industry-standard core and come with a wide range of tools and software, makes this family of products appropriate for both small projects and platform decisions. These microcontrollers can be found in everything from small printers to complicated circuit boards in automobiles. 
# LED
Light Emitting Diode. When current passes through a light-emitting diode (LED), it produces light. Electrons recombine with electron holes in the semiconductor, producing energy in the form of photons. The energy required for electrons to pass the band gap of the semiconductor determines the hue of light (equivalent to photon energy). Multiple semiconductors or a coating of light-emitting phosphor on the semiconductor device are used to produce white light.

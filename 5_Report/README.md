## ABSTRACT
The wiper cleans the front and rear windshields of the car, though not all cars have wipers on the back side. Oil, dust, precipitation, and filth that become caught on the windshield are removed by the wiper. The operational speed of a vehicle wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control mechanism based on rain conditions. To generate, the control system incorporates a rain sensor (30) that detects rain conditions. The amplitude of an analogue signal depends on the detected rain conditions. This project is mainly about developing wiper control system using STM32. Its aim is to make the wiper control system by using a button and 4 LED's. This wiper control system uses 3 LED's to control the wipers and one LED is for acc mode of the car to ON or OFF mode. If we press the button for 2 or 3 seconds the car should ON or OFF. If we press the button for one second the speed of the wiper should be changed. This is the over all idea of the project.
